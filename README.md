-Overall polish - I tried.

-As the game progresses, the overall brightness decreases, creating a more challenging environment. This design emphasizes the importance of finding light-emitting items, such as a flashlight, to navigate the maze effectively.

-Enemies add an additional layer of difficulty, as colliding with them causes the player to return to the starting point of the maze. This mechanic encourages players to strategize their movements carefully.

-The flag is placed at a random position within the maze, often as far as possible from the player's starting point, providing a clear goal while adding to the game's complexity.
Items are thoughtfully positioned to enhance gameplay, ensuring players remain engaged as they search for helpful tools.

## Future Development
-I want to make the enemies capable of more diverse movements, adding complexity to their behavior.

-I aim to enhance the visual aspects of the game, making it more vibrant and visually appealing.

-The flag is currently placed at a random position in the maze, but I plan to ensure it spawns as far as possible from the player.

-I also want to carefully consider the placement of items to enhance the gameplay experience.
